# Baseball: On the Clock

## Analyzing the effects of the implementation of the pitch clock on pither's performance.

In 2023, Major League Baseball implemented a pitch clock in an effort to speed up the pace of play of games. 
There has been ample research on how this improved the length of games and its effect on the fan experience, 
but there has not been much public research into the pitch clockâ€™s effect on the performance of pitchers. 
Using data from the advanced statistical website Baseball Savant, I researched some trends in the correlation 
of pitcher tempo to performance over the last several seasons and how this changed during the 2023 season with 
the implementation of the pitch clock. I have used a few different tests to assess the statistical differences 
in pitcher tempo and performance from the pre clock and clock eras and will use this to assess how the clock 
has effected pitchers.
